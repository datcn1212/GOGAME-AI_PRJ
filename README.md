# MINIGO - AI_PRJ
Project for AI subject - MiniGo </p>
Note: You should read the report above to understand how to play Go!

## How to run?
Step 0: Set up Python environment & install modules: numpy, pygame, itertools </p>
Step 1: Clone this repository or download zip & unzip </p>
Step 2: Run file "main.py" </p>
        Choose agent for black and white, if you choose '3' or '4' (minimax, alpha-beta prunning), you will be asked to choose depth </p>
        Then, choose 1 if you want to play with GUI, else choose 0 </p>
        Match will start soon and you will be immerse yourself in an enjoyable match! </p>
        Note: GUI will stop in 5 seconds after the match ended. </p>

## Benchmark
 If you want to evaluate benchmarks for algorithms, you can try to run this file benchmark.py. I set up two agents play with each other for 100 times, and it will show you the win rate of self agent (you can choose in terminal), average number of moves and average time.
